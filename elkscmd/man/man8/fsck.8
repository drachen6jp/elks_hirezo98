.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fIFsck\fR performs consistency checks on the file systems which reside 
on the specified devices.
When either the \fB\-a\fR or \fB\-r\fR flags are given, the file system
will be repaired if errors are found.
Before running \fIfsck\fR on a mounted file system, it must first be unmounted.
Trying to repair a mounted file system is dangerous and should not be 
attempted.
.PP
To repair the root file system (which cannot be unmounted), first 
kill any and all processes. 
Type \fIsync\fR to force any buffered changes to disk,
run \fIfsck\fR on the root file system and immediately reboot the
computer by typing \fIreboot\fR.
.PP
It is necessary to kill all processes before repairing the root file system
to prevent them from modifying any disk blocks while \fIfsck\fR is running.
This is only necessary for the root file system, any other file system can
simply be unmounted before it is checked.
